### Hey there, I'm Megan ðŸ‘‹

## About me ##
I'm a software developer with a background in product management. I have successfully developed and launched several web and mobile applications, as well as APIs. I embrace challenging problems. I have a strong history of working with teams to tackle difficult technical problems and I don't mind a good whiteboard session to talk through class design, database schema's, or state management.
